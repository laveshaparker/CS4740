\section{Preprocessing}
\subsection*{Question 1}

\textbf{Give an overview of what you did, explaining any decisions you've made. (E.g. Did you throw away any part of the text? What was considered a word token? Why?)}
\\

% Our answer
We have structured every token in the emails as a custom Unigram object. Our unigram object stores all of the important data that we derive from a token in an email.\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/unigram.png}
\textit{An excerpt from the Unigram class.}
\end{center}
We used the Stanford NLP parser to tokenize the emails. Our tokenizing can be broken into separate sections:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item POS Tagging and Lemmatizing:\\
The part-of-speech tags for each of the tokens in our dataset is used very heavily in our classification. In addition to storing the token as it appears in the email, part-of-speech tag, appearance count, and lemma of a given token instantiated as a Unigram, we always reference that Unigram using a key that is formed as "<lemma> <part-of-speech tag>". Therefore, whenever we try to compare a new token against our training models, we are really comparing the lemmatized version of the token along with its part-of-speech tag to the training models. This better maintains the intended use of the tokens in the original emails. and leads to a higher prediction accuracy.
\item Removing case:\\
Simply casting all email content to lower case drastically decreased the number of tokens in our models and increased our social-relationship prediction accuracy on the validation set by 2\%. We found that proper nouns were still classified as such, even with the case removed (i.e. "Natalie" and "natalie" are both parsed as \texttt{NNP}). That was our main concern when we decided to test our predictions in a case-insensitive environment, so that was positive reinforcement on our decision to use a single case throughout our classification process.
\end{itemize}

In terms of text that we "threw away," a major simplification we used was that of numbers. We achieved a 3\% increase in accuracy of our predictions when we simplified the way we used numbers. Upon reviewing the numeric tokens found in the training and validation sets, we derived five useful classifications of numbers. The classes are as follows:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Phone Numbers:\\
We accept the three most popular formats for phone numbers: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Phone numbers separated by hyphens (-), periods (.), or spaces: XXX-XXX-XXXX, XXX.XXX.XXXX, XXX XXX XXXX
	\item Phone numbers with no separators: XXXXXXXXXX
	\item Phone numbers with the area code emphasized: (XXX) XXX-XXXX
	\end{itemize}
\item Time:\\
The majority of times in the data set followed the pattern "HH:MM," where "H" is an hour and "M" is a minute. We allow for single-digit specification of hours and minutes as well.
\item Date:\\
We process dates of the form MM/DD/YYYY, as is the format for the majority of dates.
\item Zipcode:\\
Either 5 or 9 numeric characters together, in proper zipcode format
\item General Number:
Anything that is numeric, but does not fit the above categories. i.e. "1,234,567,910", "1111111", "+11111", etc.
\end{itemize}

Each of the cases above for numeric tokens were then used to represent the token itself. In that way, a number like "1,234,567,910" is recognized by our system as a "generic\_number", instead of as "1,234,567,910". This allowed us to better group similar numeric tokens, instead of depending heavily on the actual values of the numeric tokens.

\section{Random sentence generation}
\subsection*{Question 5}

\textbf{Give an overview of what you did, explaining any decisions you've made.}
\\

The Random Sentence Generator (RSG) is written in \texttt{RSG.java}. Running the main method will produce 50 random sentences for each of the 6 language models (unigram, bigram, trigram; and downspeak, upspeak for each).\\

\texttt{RSG.java} requires the 6 \texttt{.txt} files in the \texttt{out} directory. These files contain, for each of the language models, a list of all n-grams and the number of times each one appears in the training corpus. The information for each n-gram is given on separate line in the format  \texttt{<n-gram> <count>}.\\

It is best to describe how the RSG uses the unigram models first, since the use of the bigram and trigram models builds upon it. First, the file containing the unigrams and their counts is read in. The values are inserted to a Java ArrayList of Strings. Each unique unigram is inserted into the ArrayList an amount of times equal to its count. For example, if our input file lists:\\

\texttt{hello 3\\
there 1\\
my 2\\
friend 1}\\

the resulting  \texttt{ArrayList} will be:\\

\texttt{["hello", "hello", "hello", "there", "my", "my", "friend"]}\\

This approach was taken in order to intuitively implement distributed probability. Since  \texttt{ArrayList} is an indexed data structure, picking a random index results in selecting a random word. The more times that word appears in the  \texttt{ArrayList}, the more likely it is to be selected. Although doing this increases the running time, the extent to which it does is fairly negligible. Speed was not of concern for this project and the sentences will print out in a matter of seconds, even though the input files range from about 8,000 to 65,000 lines in length.\\

For the unigram model, $N - 0$ here is equal to 0, so each word is picked without consideration of the previous word. A String randomSentence is initialized with the start-of-sentence tag  \texttt{$<$s$>$} and has each new random word appended to it. It is returned once the end-of-sentence tag  \texttt{$<$/s$>$} has been appended or  \texttt{SENTENCE\_MAX} has been reached.\\

Generating sentences with the bigram models requires the consideration of the previous word. The RSG looks at the previous word and then reads in the bigram input file, adding to an  \texttt{ArrayList} only the bigrams that begin with the previous word. This is done in the same fashion that the unigrams were stored in (with each bigram being inserted as many times as its respective count, so that distributed probability is applied). Again, this is done repeatedly until the sentence comes to an end.\\

For the trigram models, the previous two words of the sentence being generated need to be considered. The first iteration is done exactly the same as with the bigram models because at the beginning of the sentence, there is only one previous word (the start-of-sentence tag  \texttt{$<$s$>$}). After that, new random words are picked just as they were using the bigram models but instead, we look at the previous two words. That is to say, each new word selected is the third word in the randomly selected trigram whose first two words are the previous bigram.\\

\subsection*{Question 7}

\textbf{Compare the sentences. What do they tell you about the respective models?}
\\

The sentences generated using the unigram models look truly random and are notably less intelligible than those generated by the other models. Empty sentences ("\texttt{$<$s$>$ $<$/s$>$}") were quite common, since the counts for the start- and end-of-sentence tags were relatively high. It was also more common in the unigram models for punctuation such as periods to appear in the middle of sentences.\\

The bigram models provided slightly more intelligible sentences. Familiar phrases such as "thank you" "make sure" made appearances, as well as syntactically correct phrases such as "please" followed by a verb. Additionally, a distinction began to appear between upspeak and downspeak. Upspeak seemed to contain more interrogative language such as "please" and "shall we" than the downspeak sentences did.\\

The trigram models produced more syntactically as well as semantically correct sentences than the other models. Longer phrases with discernible meaning appeared, such as "Rick will hold a conference call," "sorry for the extra time," and "I want to make payment directly." Overall, there was a direct relationship between N and the quality of the sentences in terms of syntax and comprehensibility.

\section{Unknown Word Handling and Laplace Smoothing}

\subsection*{Question 8}

\textbf{Give an overview of what you did, explaining any decisions you?ve made. (E.g. How are you handling the unknown words and why?)}
\\

We initially implemented add-one smoothing (mostly due to the fact that it was a required part of the assignment), but we soon realized that it was largely inaccurate. Because of some feedback on Piazza about the inaccuracy of Kneser-Ney Discounting for this particular data set, we opted to implement Good-Turing Smoothing as our main smoothing method.\\

We initially tried to use a combination of the various implemented smoothing methods (unigram, bigram, trigram add-on and unigram, bigram, and trigram Good-Turing) when classifying an email as up or down. This approach, however, led to largely inaccurate results. The add-one smoothing methods and the less complex N-gram models using Good-Turing Smoothing were just too unpredictable and ineffective at classifying emails, which was decreasing the overall effectiveness of the classifier. In the end, we opted with using the trigram Good-Turing model on it's own, and this drastically increased our classification ability.\\

Unknown words are handled using the add-one method so that they had a nonzero probability. This was used in conjunction with Good-Turing smoothing as listed above. Depending on the type of unknown string, we used more complex classification methods. More specifically, times, dates, zip-codes, and phone numbers all had their own unique classification. These were kept separate and handled differently from the more general group of all unknown words.
