In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I would like to interview you as a leader. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events conspired to bring you to Enron, what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a significant change in your career.

If you would be amenable and have the time, I would like to interview you sometime next week for about 30-40 minutes. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

Thank you for considering this request.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period.
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.

Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

Organization Announcement (Correction)

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided below.

It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, please welcome Ken in his new role.

As they say, "All good things must come to an end."

Unfortunately, this is hardly ever more true than in the IT consulting realm.  I have been informed that as of this Friday (11/30/2001), my assignment here at Enron comes to an end.  Obviously, Enron's current economic uncertainty predicated the need to alleviate any and all "excess baggage" (read: consultant/contractor costs).

I truly have enjoyed my time here in the Gas Fundamentals group.  I have definitely learned a great deal from everyone, and hopefully have helped others to do the same.  I leave my contact information below, in hopes that if there is anything I can do for you in the future, you will not hesitate to get in touch with me (especially to let me know what time to be at Front Porch! ;-).

All kidding aside, this has been a great overall experience for me.  From now until Friday, I will be involved in handing off all projects/initiatives that I have been a part of (or directly responsible for).  If there is anything needed of me (between now and then), feel free to give me a call (x5-8885) or stop by (ECS 06836) prior to Friday.

Thanks for everything, and I wish everyone the best of luck in their future endeavors.

Sincerely,
Chris Hyde

Chris,

Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need
any more information.

Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen
sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total
of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by
a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295
contracts over the same period.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,
